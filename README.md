# Overview 

In this project we will create a system that recommend movies to users based on inputed movies.

# Business Problem

A movie streaming service has recently noticed that their customers has become less engaging on their platform. To resolve this issue they hired us to create a movie recommendation system based on user input.

# Data

For this project, we used multiple datasets from MovieLens in order to make our final database.

# Methods

This project uses surprise model to make recommendation system. We went through the datas to cleaned and organized it; then merge all of the information together. This approach was taken because in order for us to understand the movies better to come up with recommendations for user, we needed the model to be able to see how the movie inputed have similar qualities to the recommended movies. We then used KNN to groups similar data points into cluster to make predictions. Lastly, we us

# Results & Conclusions

We made a recommendation system that has a 0.873 RMSE, which can be better improved on if we were to have more time and data. Our next in creating a better model would be collecting more in depth data about the user, more reviews and trying out other deeper learning models.
