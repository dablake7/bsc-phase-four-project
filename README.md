# Overview 

In this project we will create a system that recommend movies to users based on inputed movies.

# Business Problem

A client has no idea what to watch but knows what kind of movie he wants to watch. So, he decided to create a recommendation system that gives users movie recommendations based on user input.

# Data

For this project, we used multiple datasets in order to make our database. We found data from Kaggle which gave us more information on the movies that were present in our original dataset.

# Methods

This project uses surprise model to make recommendation system. We went on Kaggle to find information on the movies. We then went through the datas to cleaned and organized it; then merge all of the information together. This approach was taken because in order for us to understand the movies better to come up with recommendations for user, we needed the model to be able to see how the movie inputed have similar qualities to the recommended movies.
